# Softball Analytics: Senior Thesis Project
## Project Description

This project is a softball analytics platform designed to make it easy for coaches to record, access, and analyze in-game data directly from an iPad. Our goal is to streamline the process of scorekeeping and stat tracking so that coaches can spend less time wrestling with spreadsheets and more time making strategic decisions.

Key features include:

Simple Data Entry – Coaches can quickly log plays, pitches, and outcomes during games using a clean, touch-friendly interface.

Cloud Synchronization – All data is stored securely using Apple’s CloudKit, ensuring that stats are automatically synced across devices and always available to the coaching staff.

Statistical Analysis – The system computes player and team-level statistics, helping coaches evaluate performance over time and identify key areas for improvement.

Collaboration-Ready – Multiple coaches can access the same dataset, eliminating version-control headaches and ensuring the whole staff is on the same page.

By reducing the overhead of data management, this tool allows coaches to focus on what matters most: helping their players succeed on the field.
